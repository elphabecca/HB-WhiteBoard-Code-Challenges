"""Split astring by splitter and return list of splits.

This should work like that built-in Python .split() method [*].
YOU MAY NOT USE the .split() method in your solution!
YOU MAY NOT USE regular expressions in your solution!

For example:

    >>> split("i love balloonicorn", " ")
    ['i', 'love', 'balloonicorn']

    >>> split("that is which is that which is that", " that ")
    ['that is which is', 'which is that']

    >>> split("that is which is that which is that", "that")
    ['', ' is which is ', ' which is ', '']

    >>> split("hello world", "nope")
    ['hello world']

* Note: the actual Python split method has special behavior
  when it is not passed anything for the splitter -- you do
  not need to implemented that.
